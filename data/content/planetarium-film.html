I left Skopje in October 1973, and, once in Paris, I headed for the Pigalle metro station. The air down there was heavy and humid. It reminded one of the old age of the metropolis. In the pockets of my army jacket I had a bottle of water, my shaving kit, a few cans, a mirror and some other trinkets.
I spent three nights there with tramps and other vagrants. Every now and then a police officer or some other official would warn us that sleeping is not allowed in the metro. But none of us paid attention. On the fourth day I left and headed for the Place du Tertre.
</p>
<p>
In those days Paris was all charm and saga.
It appeared as if it had transformed the proud Gallic idyll into eternity. I was under the impression that everybody loved everybody.
That afternoon, among other painters, I met a friend from my home town. I spent the next three months in a cellar that he vacated for me, free of charge. He dropped by every day just to leave his painting gear there.
The cellar had an earth floor, there was no electricity, no water, no toilet. It was damp everywhere. The mattress smelled of mold.
</p>
<p>After some twenty days I began to feel chest pains. It must be tuberculosis, I thought. And yet I was lucky – I had a roof over my head.
From time to time, during the night, an insect or rat would run over me.. The darkness of the cellar gripped my soul like a steel clamp.
But all this had already become part of my life.
</p>
<p>
I soon started studying painting, and later, film directing. I earned my living doing all kinds of manual labour. As time went by I made a living doing portraits or silhouettes.
</p>
<p>
Then I lost my work permit.
This way of doing business was forbidden.
</p>
<p>
It was then that I finally decided to devote myself to painting only. I witnessed and participated in a life full of cigarettes, alcohol, sleepless nights and frequent brawls in bohemian Montmartre.
But I also saw the great friendship between us, the painters, and the people who lived in the neighbourhood.
In those days glorious Montmartre was the soul of Paris. We painted by day and lived out our youth by night. The thirst for friendship hovered above us.
</p>
<p>
Three wonderful tramps and a white dog named Pony lived with us. Montmartre will remember them all as the four princes of the free spirit of the small square. Soon death began to separate them.
</p>
<p>
The first tramp, who went by the name of Napoleon, died of thrombosis on a staircase. Pishta, a former Hungarian legionnaire, set himself on fire in broad daylight and burned before our very eyes.
Andre died of pneumonia and Pony joined them a short while later. One morning this unique stray dog was run down by a car. It seemed as if the death of the four veterans marked the end of the warm soul of the old square. The painters were becoming middle-aged.
</p>
<p>
The morning greetings were no longer what they used to be.
The walls of distance were rising like skyscrapers.
Although separated by only a yard, we would not exchange a single word, for weeks. And whether it was because of jadedness or fatigue, there was ever less friendship among us.
And the years went by.
</p>
<p>The Place du Tertre was advancing towards its deep autumn.
My agent Michael and I arrived in New York toward the end of 1988. We were in good spirits.
Before our departure we had received a postcard from Alberta inviting us to visit her.
Michael had told me many times in Paris about their love affair. She lived in a luxurious apartment near Central Park.
After a short buzz, the door opened and an endless dialogue ensued between Michael and Alberta.
</p>
<p>
It seemed to me that certain coldness was creeping in.
We were tired and hungry, but more than that, we felt helpless and miserable. It seemed as if we had come from some underworld without the right to see the light. I had a feeling that I was becoming alienated from myself. It looked as if we were both entering the hallway of some polar chamber.
This strange woman was depriving me in a very painful way of my vision of New York and America.
</p>
<p>
And I thought:
Am I indeed becoming alienated from myself?
</p>
<p>
Passing through many American cities, Michael and I arrived in New Orleans. I was running out of money. We were planning to spend the night in a deserted boat. However, a friend of ours introduced us to a lady who agreed to give us a room for three dollars. Madam Olson had been a Hollywood starlet in the 1930s. The walls of her apartment were plastered with photographs from her young days. The glory of her bygone beauty loomed over all those photographs. The apartment had three rooms. In each room there was a TV set and many lightbulbs. She immediately warned us that in her home they had to be turned on at all times. The windows in all the rooms were walled up. The sight excited hopelessness.
</p>
<p>
It seemed as if Madame Olson had painted a fresco of her loneliness in this sealed space.
Were the lightbulbs and the TV sets which were always turned on the windows of her soul? And yet, during that night, as we were trying to get some sleep, it seemed that the old age of this lonely woman bounced off the walls of her strange home. The next morning, Madame Olson prepared a breakfast which consisted of an omelette made with one egg and some onion, and a slice of bread.
</p>
<p>
She shared her meal with us. Later, I was long
haunted by the great soul of this lonely old woman.
I can feel her presence close to me, like the gentle mother of all mothers.
Paris. A late November night, and it had not stopped raining for three days.
Through my studio window I watched the dark silhouette of an exhausted dog.
Its slow stride revealed its old age. To the left stood a container full of garbage. I could catch a glimpse of my latest painting in the depths of my studio. I watched it silently. It was worn out and without soul. It looked like a squeezed mass hurled into space. I was helpless and lonely in my despair. I wanted to destroy it, to burn it up, but I did not have the strength to walk the distance from the window to the painting.
Paris. Several years had gone by…
</p>
<p>
One night I was wandering from bar to bar. It was August. The streets were deserted and nothing was happening. When I returned to my studio I had no wish to do anything.
There was not enough breathing space. It was filled with things. I began to look for some space to begin painting, but I could not see it.
I became depressed.
I was distraught and I hated myself from the depths of my soul.
I started breaking and burning everything that was within my reach. I threw the radio, the table and the mattress through the window.
</p>
<p>
For the next three years I slept on boards.
The empty room began to resemble an erased space. Paints and canvases were littered all over the place. I tried to understand time, I tried to caress it. I imagined it as a prince who was now on a ship, now in a desert, now on a cloud…
Then I watched how it ran on for years on and across different crossroads. Through the archives of my memory I wanted to reach the freedom of its omnipotence.
And I still keep travelling and trying to reach the universe of its freedom. But time begins once again to drift away…
</p>

My dear child
Today is November 6, 1996. This morning I touched for the very first time the tomb of Jesus Christ and wept for the soul of my mother, of my father and for all poor souls.
The Son of God, crucified and eternal, was above me on the cross.
It seemed that the pain of Golgotha hovered above the candle smoke. Then I passed by the Wailing Wall, and the scent of eternity was in the Jerusalem air.
That night I had a premonition. I realized that I must burn my Planetarium in eternal Jerusalem in order to resurrect the spirit of a new offspring, Planetarium.
