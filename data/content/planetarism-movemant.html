<p>Although time and space are without beginning and end, man tries to limit them, to define them... He does the same with art, dividing it into painting, sculpture, music, film, video, literature, design, theatre, as if they were hermetically closed within themselves.</p>
<p>Planetarism is envisioned as a result or a common denominator of several art, whereby each of those parts retains its own specifics. Still, the art lover, or the artist himself should feel, find and valorize the form and the content of this sublime frequency called art.</p>
<p>For example, the form of the dancer's body is volume to the sculptor, and the sculpture is part of the stage setting of a theatre performance. Thus, things continue to arrange themselves further. Regardless of whether it is the written word, the film tape or the video, the colour of the gesture of the painter's pallet, the film tape or the video, the music as a universal language... But I also imagine Planetarism as a free electron of the human spirit which can be reincarnated from one type of art into another one, or all its individual segments can interwine like in a snake's nest. This lofty energy which moves, changes and upgrades is the wondrous magician which illuminates the universal formula of the cosmic cure for the human soul which needs to be ennobled and humanized.</p>
