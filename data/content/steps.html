<p>This film was shot in the fashionable city of Knokke in Belgium.
The entire action of the film takes place in a small space between a gallery and the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.

One day, while I was drinking coffee from a small plastic cup, quite unintentionally I began to imagine the small plastic cup as the soul of a little helpless being. And is there anything that can inflict tremendous pain of the soul, except injustice? And so that little plastic cup of coffee left in the sun, rain, wind and sand that was constantly moving back and forth was experiencing everyday human destiny. At one point someone would kick it away, at a second one a bicycle wheel would pass over it, at a third one the wind would relocate it…. It is more than obvious that this resembled human destiny. Well, isn’t life a set of steps?
