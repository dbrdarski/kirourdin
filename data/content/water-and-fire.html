The world has turned into water and fire. Or into flood and wildfire. In this dramatic moment of human history, when the ice surface of Antarctica turns into land, when in the streets of cities rivers begin to flow, or water collects in ponds, when temperatures ominously remind us that planet Earth will soon be turned into planet Fire, it is obvious that everything has gone awry. A man plays the main role of a predator, like a ruthless screenwriter and director who knows no boundaries. During this incomprehensible spree driven by megalomaniac greed for money, the levels of toxins grow, the air is polluted, and the same goes for water. All this has a direct effect on fish that live in those waters and swallow all that plastic, the animals which are left without the ground beneath their legs, and the birds which lose the clean air beneath their wings.

Everywhere seas and oceans rise of concrete jungles, buildings, undergrounds, roads, highways, warehouses for chemicals and weapons, abandoned vehicles gravesitesâ€¦

Everything is in a tight space, because everything rises. The bullet of human greed brutally kills everything in its path, suppressing the planetary cry to rescue the beautiful planet Earth.
