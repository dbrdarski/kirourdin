DEBBIE WILSON AND PLANETARIUM

Sometimes unpredictable things happen in life. Such an unpredictable thing is my collaboration with the great choreographer Debbie Wilson who lives and works in Toronto.

By coincidence Debbie saw my film “Planetarium” and proposed to me to do a ballet performance based on the film script. Thus, our cooperation was born.

The work was first performed in Toronto by the dancers from OMO Dance Theatre and MNT (Macedonian National Theatre).

The artists from Canada were from various nationalities, precisely in the spirit of planetarism.

This was followed by performances in Skopje, Ohrid, Heraclea, Chicago, Ankara, as well as the performance in Geneva to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.

In her interview Debbie very explicitly spoke of the eternal dilemmas and material uncertainty when it comes to living off the arts, referring to the moments of the joint project.
